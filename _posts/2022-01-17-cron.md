# Scheduling Cron Jobs with Crontab

Setting up scheduled jobs in unix/mac is simple. [Here](https://www.example.com/) is a description of cron.   

There are five steps to create a simple task.  

1. Set up a bash script that describes the task.  

    In the terminal, change directory to a local folder and edit a new file.  

    ```bash
    cd ~/path/to/dir
    nano hello.sh
    ```

    Add the following lines to the file, press control + X to save and exit.  

    ```bash
    now=$(date)
    echo "Hello World, it's $now"
    ```

2. Create a cron file that schedules the task. 
 
    In the terminal, change directory to a local folder and edit a new file.  
    ```bash
    cd ~/path/to/dir
    nano cron
    ```
    Add the following line to the file, press control + X to save and exit.  
    ```bash
    31 16 * * * cd ~/path/to/dir/ && bash ./hello.sh >| hello.log
    ```
    The cron task syntax is as follows: 
    ```bash
    (minute) (hour) (day of the month) (month) (day of the week) <command>   
    ```
    
    Specifying a * in place of each parameter defaults to all. The example above refers to a task that runs every day of every month at 4:31 pm local time.  

3. Submit the cron task.  

    In the terminal, type the following to submit the tasks in the cronjob file.  
    ```bash
    crontab cronjob
    ```

4. Verify that the job was added to the task list.  
 
    In the terminal, type the following to list the tasks.  
    ```bash
    crontab -l
    ```

5. Check the output result after the task has run.
  
    In the terminal, type the following to see the output.  
    ```bash
    cat hello.log
    ```
    Here is a sample output 
    ```bash
    Hello World, it's Wed Mar 31 16:31:00 MDT 2021
    ```

There is a lot you can do with crontab. The above will hopefully help you get started.
