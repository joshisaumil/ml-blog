title: Scheduling Cron Jobs with Crontab

## Introduction

Setting up scheduled jobs in unix/mac is simple.  

[Here](https://www.example.com/) is a description of cron.  

There are five steps to create a simple task.  

## Describe the task

Set up a bash script that describes the task.  

In the terminal, change directory to a local folder and edit a new file.  

```bash
cd ~/path/to/dir
nano hello.sh
```

Add the following lines to the file, press control + X to save and exit.  

```bash
now=$(date)
echo "Hello World, it's $now"
```

## Schedule the task
 
In the terminal, change directory to a local folder and edit a new file.  
```bash
cd ~/path/to/dir
nano cron
```
Add the following line to the file, press control + X to save and exit.  
```bash
31 16 * * * cd ~/path/to/dir/ && bash ./hello.sh >| hello.log
```
The cron task syntax is as follows: 
```bash
(minute) (hour) (day of the month) (month) (day of the week) <command>   
```
    
Specifying a * in place of each parameter defaults to all. The example above refers to a task that runs every day of every month at 4:31 pm local time.  

## Submit the task

In the terminal, type the following to submit the tasks in the cronjob file.  
```bash
crontab cronjob
```

Verify that crontab was updated with the new task list. In the terminal, type the following to list the tasks.  

```bash
crontab -l
```

## Check results
  
Check the output result after the task has run.  

In the terminal, type the following to see the output.  
```bash
cat hello.log
```
Here is a sample output 
```bash
Hello World, it's Wed Mar 31 16:31:00 MDT 2021
```

There is a lot you can do with crontab. The above will hopefully help you get started.
