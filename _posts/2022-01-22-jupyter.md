## Jupyter notebook
Jupyter Notebook is a web application for creating and sharing computational (code + notebooks + data) documents. JupyterLab is the next generation implementation of Jupyter notebooks.[^1]  

Jupyter architecture consists of
- a kernel (which executes code)
- a client (the browser)
- a notebook (contains code, metadata, contents, outputs)
- a notebook server (saves and loads notebooks)

Documentation: [Jupyter](https://docs.jupyter.org/en/latest/)

## Setup

Create a virtual environment
```bash
python3 -m venv py3
```

Activate a virtual environment
```bash
source py3/bin/activate
```

Install Jupyter Lab
```bash
pip install jupyterlab
pip install ipykernel
```

Add kernel
```bash
ipython kernel install --user --name=py3
```

Launch Jupyter Lab
```bash
jupyter-lab
```

To list installed kernels
```bash
jupyter kernelspec list
```

To uninstall kernels
```bash
jupyter kernelspec uninstall py3
```
