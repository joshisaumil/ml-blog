            "content": "Introduction . Transfer learning allows us to use trained layers from other models and applying them to our models. We can save time and resources by not having to train large networks. . Objective . We want to classify the images in the CIFAR10 dataset. . Approach . Here we use the ResNet50 model for image classification. We add some fully connected layers to classify the learned features into ten categories. . 1. Import Libraries . import math import tensorflow as tf import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import numpy as np from tensorflow.keras import Model from tensorflow.keras import layers from tensorflow.keras.applications import ResNet50 . 2. Load the dataset . CIFAR10 dataset is readily accessible through keras. . (train_img, train_lbl), (test_img, test_lbl) = tf.keras.datasets.cifar10.load_data() . Downloading data from https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar-10-python.tar.gz 126459904/170498071 [=====================&gt;........] - ETA: 3s . 3. Preprocess images . Pre-processing converts RGB to BGR, zero-centers each color channel with respect to the ImageNet dataset. . train_img = (train_img).astype(&#39;float32&#39;) test_img = (test_img).astype(&#39;float32&#39;) train_img = tf.keras.applications.resnet50.preprocess_input(train_img) test_img = tf.keras.applications.resnet50.preprocess_input(test_img) NUM_EPOCHS = 20 print(&#39;Test images: &#39;, test_img.shape) print(&#39;Train images: &#39;, train_img.shape) . 4. Load ResNet50 model . Use weights from imagenet, do not include the top layers, and freeze each layer to not-trainable. We want to use the trained model as is with some modifications. . pre_trained_model = ResNet50(input_shape = (224, 224, 3), weights=&#39;imagenet&#39;, classes = 10, include_top = False) for layer in pre_trained_model.layers: layer.trainable = False . 5. Create model . Specify shape of images for input. | Upsample image size by 7x to match ResNet50 architecture. | Add the pre-trained model. | Flatten the output of the model. | Add a few dense layers to adapt the model to your dataset. Use the relu activation function. | Specify the output with 10 output categories and a softmax activation. | . inputs = tf.keras.layers.Input(shape=(32,32,3)) x = tf.keras.layers.UpSampling2D(size=(7,7))(inputs) x = (pre_trained_model)(x) x = layers.GlobalAveragePooling2D()(x) x = layers.Dense(1024, activation=&#39;relu&#39;)(x) x = layers.Dropout(0.2)(x) x = layers.Dense(512, activation=&#39;relu&#39;)(x) x = layers.Dense(10, activation=&#39;softmax&#39;)(x) tx_model = tf.keras.Model(inputs = inputs, outputs = x) . 6. Compile model . Use Stochastic Gradient Descent for optimization, sparse categorical crossentropy as the loss parameter, and accuracy as the metric. Then fit the model using the training images and labels. . tx_model.compile(optimizer=&#39;SGD&#39;, loss=&#39;sparse_categorical_crossentropy&#39;, metrics = [&#39;accuracy&#39;]) tx_model.summary() history = tx_model.fit(train_img, train_lbl, batch_size=256, epochs = NUM_EPOCHS, validation_data = (test_img, test_lbl), verbose = 1) . 7. Plot results . Plot the response (accuracy and loss) by epochs for the training and validation sets. . acc=history.history[&#39;accuracy&#39;] val_acc=history.history[&#39;val_accuracy&#39;] loss=history.history[&#39;loss&#39;] val_loss=history.history[&#39;val_loss&#39;] epochs=range(len(acc)) plt.plot(epochs, acc, &#39;o-r&#39;, label=&#39;Training&#39;) plt.plot(epochs, val_acc, &#39;o--b&#39;, label=&#39;Test&#39;) plt.title(&#39;Accuracy: Training and Validation&#39;) plt.legend(loc=&quot;lower right&quot;) plt.figure() plt.plot(epochs, loss, &#39;o-r&#39;, label=&#39;Training&#39;) plt.plot(epochs, val_loss, &#39;o--b&#39;, label=&#39;Test&#39;) plt.title(&#39;Loss: Training and Validation&#39;) plt.legend(loc=&quot;upper right&quot;) .",

Set up a bash script that describes the task. . In the terminal, change directory to a local folder and edit a new file. . cd ~/path/to/dir nano hello.sh . Add the following lines to the file, press control + X to save and exit. . now=$(date) echo &quot;Hello World, it&#39;s $now&quot; . Schedule the task . In the terminal, change directory to a local folder and edit a new file. . cd ~/path/to/dir nano cron . Add the following line to the file, press control + X to save and exit. . 31 16 * * * cd ~/path/to/dir/ &amp;&amp; bash ./hello.sh &gt;| hello.log . The cron task syntax is as follows: . (minute) (hour) (day of the month) (month) (day of the week) &lt;command&gt; . Specifying a * in place of each parameter defaults to all. The example above refers to a task that runs every day of every month at 4:31 pm local time. . Submit the task . In the terminal, type the following to submit the tasks in the cronjob file. . crontab cronjob . Verify that crontab was updated with the new task list. In the terminal, type the following to list the tasks. . crontab -l . Check results . Check the output result after the task has run. . In the terminal, type the following to see the output. . cat hello.log . Here is a sample output . Hello World, it&#39;s Wed Mar 31 16:31:00 MDT 2021 . There is a lot you can do with crontab.
